## Project Overview

The **Minimal Library Management System** is a React + Redux Toolkit Query + TypeScript based client application designed to manage books and borrowing operations. It interfaces with a Node.js and Express.js backend powered by MongoDB. This system facilitates the viewing, creation, updating, deletion, and borrowing of books â€” all without authentication or complex integrations, focusing on essential library functionalities.
